<h2> Bayesian statistics for high-dimensional and nonparametric models </h2>
<h3> Abstract </h3>
<p> 
In the Bayesian statistical paradigm a prior probability distribution on the
parameter space is updated to a posterior probability distribution after seeing the data. The latter is simply the conditional distribution of the parameter given the data, based on viewing the likelihood as the conditional distribution of the data given the parameter. In nonparametric statistics the parameter is an infinite-dimensional object, such as a function or a distribution, and the prior is a probability distribution over the appropriate infinite-dimensional space. In high-dimensional statistics the parameter space is Euclidean, but there are typically more parameters than observations. A large variety of prior distributions have been developed, usually together with algorithms to simulate from the posterior distribution. In this course we shall consider the Dirichlet process and Dirichlet mixtures, Gaussian process priors, and the spike-and-slab and horseshoe priors for sparse high-dimensional models, among others. We shall further mostly be concerned with the question if Bayesian inference with these priors `works'. This entails two main desirables. First one would like that a posterior distribution concentrates most of its mass near the `true' parameter if in reality (and deviating from the Bayesian assumption) the data were sample according to this true parameter. This property can be captured by a contraction rate (if any) of the posterior distribution as the informativeness of the data (e.g. the number of observations) increases indefinitely.  Second one would like that the spread of the posterior distribution can be interpreted somewhat in the same fashion as the width of confidence sets. We shall see that the desirables are met by large classes of priors, but that, unlike for finite-dimensional models, the prior does play an important role in the asymptotics. Families of priors with a tuning parameter (bandwidth, smoothness, sparsity level, etc.), which can itself be equipped with a prior or estimated by empirical Bayes, are especially attractive.

<h3> Biography of the Lecturer (<a href="http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~avdvaart/info.html">Source</a>)  </h3>
<b>Aad van der Vaart</b> studied mathematics, philosophy and psychology 
at the University of Leiden, and
received a PhD in mathematics from this university in 1987.
He held positions in College Station, Texas and Paris (not in Texas), held a Miller fellowship in Berkeley, and was 
visiting professor in Berkeley, Harvard and Seattle. Following a long connection
to the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam
he is currently <i>Professor of Stochastics</i>
at Leiden University. He is a member of the 
<a href="http://www.knaw.nl/">Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts
and Sciences</a>. His research has been funded by NWO, VU-USF, STW, CMSB, NDNS+, STAR,
  and most recently by the European Research Council
  (<a href="http://erc.europa.eu/funding-and-grants/funding-schemes/advanced-grants">ERC Advanced Grant</a>, 2012).
 He received the C.J. Kok prize in 1988, the <a href="http://www.vvs-or.nl/en/menu/VvS_OR_Awards/Van_Dantzig_Award"> van Dantzig award</a> in 2000, and 
  the <a href="http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/spinoza+prize">NWO Spinoza
  Prize</a> in 2015.

<br><br>
  Aad van der Vaart's research is in statistics and probability,
  as mathematical disciplines and in their applications to other sciences, with
  an emphasis on statistical models with large parameter spaces. He wrote 
  books and lecture notes (on topics such as empirical processes, time series, stochastic
  integration, option pricing, statistical genetics, statistical learning, Bayesian nonparametrics),
  as well as research papers. See <a href="http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~avdvaart/research.html">research page</a> for
  more information.
